# consultant-landing-page

This is a **full responsive landing page**. It is a website for consultant about traffic permit and transport.
I used javascript for the FAQ section and the slide section. I also added some css animation for the latter.
A handle the front-end errors in the from section, you have to enter the name and the password and the latter must: be from 8 to 20 character, have at least one capital letter and one number. 
I added the **meta tag** and **open graph tag** to improve the social share visibility and the SEO.

I used **toggle** and **trello** to time and organize the different steps of building of my project.
